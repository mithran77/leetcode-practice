# 76. Minimum Window Substring

# Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such
# that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring,
# return the empty string "".

# The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

# A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
# Output: "BANC"
# Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "a", t = "a"
# Output: "a"
# Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
# Output: ""
# Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
# Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.

# Constraints:

# m == s.length
# n == t.length
# 1 <= m, n <= 105
# s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

# Follow up: Could you find an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?
