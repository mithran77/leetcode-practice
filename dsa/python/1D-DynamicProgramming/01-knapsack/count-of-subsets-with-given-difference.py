# Partitions with Given Difference

# Given an array arr[] and an integer diff, count the number of ways
# to partition the array into two subsets such that the difference
# between their sums is equal to diff.

# Note: A partition in the array means dividing an array into two subsets
# say S1 and S2 such that the union of S1 and S2 is equal to the original
# array and each element is present in only one of the subsets.

# Examples :

# Input: arr[] = [5, 2, 6, 4], diff = 3
# Output: 1
# Explanation: There is only one possible partition of this array.
# Partition : [6, 4], [5, 2]. The subset difference between subset
# sum is: (6 + 4) - (5 + 2) = 3.

# Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1], diff = 0
# Output: 6
# Explanation: We can choose two 1's from indices
# [0,1], [0,2], [0,3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3] and put them in sum1 and
# remaning two 1's in sum2.
# Thus there are total 6 ways for partition the array arr.

# Input: arr[] = [3, 2, 7, 1], diff = 4
# Output: 0
# Explanation: There is no possible partition of the array that satisfy
# the given difference.

# Constraint:
# 1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 50
# 0 ≤ diff ≤ 50
# 0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 6
