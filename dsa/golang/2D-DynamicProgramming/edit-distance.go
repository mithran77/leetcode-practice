    72. Edit Distance

    Given two strings word1 and word2,
    return the minimum number of
    operations required to convert
    word1 to word2.

    You have the following three
    operations permitted on a word:

    Insert a character
    Delete a character
    Replace a character

    Example 1:
    Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: 
    horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
    rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
    rose -> ros (remove 'e')

    Example 2:
    Input: word1 = "intention",
    word2 = "execution"
    Output: 5
    Explanation: 
    intention -> inention (remove 't')
    inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
    enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
    exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
    exection -> execution (insert 'u')
    

    Constraints:
    0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500
    word1 and word2 consist of lowercase
    English letters.
