    1046. Last Stone Weight

    You are given an array of integers stones where
    stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.

    We are playing a game with the stones. On each
    turn, we choose the heaviest two stones and smash
    them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones
    have weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this
    smash is:

    If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
    If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and
    the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.
    At the end of the game, there is at most one
    stone left.

    Return the weight of the last remaining stone.
    If there are no stones left, return 0.

    Example 1:
    Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: 
    We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts
    to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
    we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts
    to [2,1,1,1] then,
    we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts
    to [1,1,1] then,
    we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts
    to [1] then that's the value of the last stone.

    Example 2:
    Input: stones = [1]
    Output: 1

    Constraints:
    1 <= stones.length <= 30
    1 <= stones[i] <= 1000
